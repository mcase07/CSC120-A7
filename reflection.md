- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

In the Cafe class I overloaded the sellCoffee() method so that there would be a standard coffee the cafe sells without any information needing to be passed in. I also overloaded the constructor so that there would be a generic cafe that could be created without any information passed in.

made a default library 
made a containsTitle that checks for three titles at once

In the Library class I overloaded the constructor so that there would be a generic library that could be created without any information passed in. I also overloaded the containsTitle() method so that it can check for three titles at once.

made a defualt house
made a moveIn method that moves in two residents at a time

In the House class, I overloaded the constructor so that there would be a generic librayr that could be created without any information being passed in. I also overloaded the moveIn() method so that two residents can be moved in at a time.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I feel like overloading wasn't that hard of a concept to grasp. Overriding I found to be a little less intuitive. I think that my containsTitle() and moveIn() overloading wasn't the most effective. I could have written the overloaded containsTitle() method to be take in as many titles as someone wanted and iterate through a list, for example. I'm also not sure if my programs need to be written to take in user input or not.
